      <description>Introduction I have been working on a RaspberryPi home server project for quite some time. The project is a collection of applications to run on RaspberryPi and all applications are deployable with docker-compose files and ansible automation. One of the applications I was configuring is Pi-hole, a network-wide ad-blocker.
I decided to use Pi-hole as also DHCP server for my LAN. When I look into docs, it says it has to be run as network_mode: host, because it allows Pi-hole to listen to DHCP broadcast packets.</description>
