      <description>Introduction I have been working on my home server setup on Raspberry Pi 4. I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy all of my services/tools in docker containers, and for that, I need a nice and fancy container management tool I want to have on my home server.
I had checked multiple sources, and finally picked two; they are Portainer and Yacht. Portainer is a well-known container management tool and Yacht is fairly new.</description>

      <guid>https://veerendra2.github.io/docker-userns-remap/</guid>
      <description>There is a cool feature in docker called userns-remap, discovered while doing my RaspberryPi home server project; 15#issuecomment-1296311979, I can just enable userns-remap and docker does all remapping of uid and gid inside docker container to a non-root user on the host.
https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/
How to enable *It is better to reinstall docker and remove all existing docker volumes
Add below /etc/docker/daemon.json { &amp;#34;userns-remap&amp;#34;: &amp;#34;default&amp;#34; } Restart the docker daemon $ sudo systemctl restart docker Ansible automation here In-Action # Run the Nginx container $ docker run -it -d nginx # Inside, the process thinks it is running as root!</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been working on a RaspberryPi home server project for quite some time. The project is a collection of applications to run on RaspberryPi and all applications are deployable with docker-compose files and ansible automation. One of the applications I was configuring is Pi-hole, a network-wide ad-blocker.
I decided to use Pi-hole as also DHCP server for my LAN. When I look into docs, it says it has to be run as network_mode: host, because it allows Pi-hole to listen to DHCP broadcast packets.</description>

      <description>Introduction Hello my dear fellow humans, hope you are having a great day. Today&amp;rsquo;s guide is on how to recover from a disaster for Strimzi Kafka with Velero. First of all, what is Strmzi Kafka?
https://strimzi.io
Strimzi provides a way to run an Apache Kafka cluster on Kubernetes in various deployment configurations.
Back in a while I worked on Strimzi Kafka deployment on Openshift, very easy to set up and manage production level Kafka cluster on kubernetes, I have to give credit to Strimzi project team, did a great job on documentation, support on Github discussions and active developments.</description>

A year back I worked on Strimzi Kafka, a deployment solution for deploying production level Kafka on Kubernetes. Strimzi Kafka uses persistance volume(PV) as a disk which is a managed disk from cloud provider(e.g. Azure, AWS, etc), but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find proper backup solution in order to configure PV backup and restore.</description>

      <description>Looks like my blog posts are like Sherlock TV Show episodes, posting once in a while..anyways I&amp;rsquo;m back now. As you might know, GitHub recently launched GitHub Actions where people can automate workflows like build, test, deploy code from GitHub.
I have started reading docs a little bit, I have to admit, setting up workflows on GitHub Actions is not that hard. I can directly start creating workflow from available workflow templates in the &amp;ldquo;Actions&amp;rdquo; tab.</description>

      <description>Hallo alle zusammen, after a long time I&amp;rsquo;m writing this blog and I come with an interesting and long post
I know what you are thinking, I steal Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes The Hard Way tutorial, but hey!, I did some research and try to fit K8s cluster(Multi-Master!) in a laptop with Docker as &amp;lsquo;CRI&amp;rsquo; and Flannel as &amp;lsquo;CNI&amp;rsquo;.
This blog post follows Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes The Hard Way, I highly recommend go through his repo.</description>

6. Bootstrapping the etcd Cluster etcd is a consistent and highly-available key value storage DB. Kubernetes stores all cluster data in etcd via api-server. In this section we will install and configure etcd on all controller nodes.</description>

In this post, we will bootstrap worker nodes and at the end, perform smoke test on the cluster
9. Bootstrapping the Kubernetes Worker Nodes As the title of this post &amp;ldquo;Kubernetes The Hard Way With Docker &amp;amp; Flannel&amp;rdquo;, what we are going to do now is different from Kelsey Hightower&amp;rsquo;s Kubernetes The Hard Way tutorial i.</description>

      <description>As we all know, enabling HTTPS to endpoints/websites is essential now-a-days. When it comes to Kubernetes, when we expose a service as LoadBalancer, the cloud provider doesn&amp;rsquo;t provide an HTTPS mechanism for the endpoint by default.
If we look at the K8s setup that is deployed on AWS(For example kops), there is an actual ELB(Elastic Load Balancer) sits in front of K8s service and load balance the traffic. AWS&amp;rsquo;s ELB is not TLS enabled by default.</description>

      <description>Wireshark is a really great tool for analyzing traffic, whether it could be live traffic on interface or .cap file. The tool enables different types filtering on packets like follow stream, filter by protocol and IP, etc
In order to install the latest version of wireshark on Linux, one should build and install from source. Sometimes, building from source is difficult because we have to hunt down the dependencies. That&amp;rsquo;s what I did for this software.</description>

      <description>Ok, getting metrics(CPU, Memory &amp;amp; Network) from Windows OS is completely different from Linux. In Linux, people can easily develop scripts to get system metrics by simply reading /proc pesudo files. In fact there are so many open source tools to do this in Linux, like tcollector which is my favourite.
Now, Let&amp;rsquo;s look at this Telegraf tool and what it does. I found Telegraf tool is really simple, elegant way to collect Windows OS metrics and light weight too, unlike others which some are paid and crappy.</description>

      <description>We think that connecting to a website over HTTPS is secure, which is true(not true sometimes!), but what about DNS queries that you(browser) send?
Sure if we use HTTPS, all your (POST or GET) data is encrypted end-to-end which prevents eavesdropping, MITM attack and have Confidentiality, but again what about DNS queries?
I got this question back in a while, so after a quick Internet search, I found DNSCrypt protocol which is really cool that I can encrypt DNS queries.</description>

      <description>A Wi-Fi deauthentication attack is a type of denial-of-service attack that targets communication between a user and a Wi-Fi wireless access point.
-Wikipedia
As you can see, this type of attack is pretty powerful and difficult to detect who is attacking. There are some tools(like ‚Äúaircrack-ng‚Äù) for this attack(You can check the commands here).
So, basically the concept is the attacker broadcasts a wifi management ‚ÄúDeauthentication‚Äù frame to the victim&amp;rsquo;s devices/PC to tell them to deauthenticate.</description>

      <description>GNU Screen is a terminal multiplexer, a software application that can be used to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple separate login sessions inside a single terminal window, or detach and reattach sessions from a terminal. It is useful for dealing with multiple programs from a command line interface, and for separating programs from the session of the Unix shell that started the program, particularly so a remote process continues running even when the user is disconnected.</description>

      <description>‚ÄúMAC Address Scrambling‚Äú- By name itself we can understand, instead of using a burned-in address, the machine uses a random MAC address. The machine/device changes MAC addresses regularly to improve security. MAC address is a 48 bit hexadecimal digit which is burned in every electronic device that has capability of ‚Äúconnectivity‚Äù such as mobile devices, smart TV, PC, etc. ‚ÄúApple‚Äù added this feature to iPhones from iOS8 to protect user‚Äôs privacy.</description>
