Ok, getting metrics(CPU, Memory & Network) from Windows OS is completely different from Linux. In Linux, people can easily develop scripts to get system metrics by simply reading [/proc](https://www.tldp.org/LDP/Linux-Filesystem-Hierarchy/html/proc.html) pesudo files. In fact there are so many open source tools to do this in Linux, like [tcollector](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/tcollector) which is my favourite.

Now, Let's look at this [Telegraf tool](https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/) and what it does. I found Telegraf tool is really simple, elegant way to collect Windows OS metrics and light weight too, unlike others which some are paid and crappy. This tools doesn't provide any wizard installation to setup, but one has to run a command in Windows powershell to install it as Windows service. It supports multiple TSDB backend storage like Graphite, OpenTSDB, etc but I have tested only with OpenTSDB.

As they said in [Github repo](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf) and I quote


>Telegraf is an agent written in Go for collecting, processing, aggregating, and writing metrics.
>
>Design goals are to have a minimal memory footprint with a plugin system so that developers in the community can easily add support for collecting metrics from local or remote services.
