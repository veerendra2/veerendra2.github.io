      <description>This is a how-to guide inspired by &amp;ldquo;Quick and Easy SSL Certificates for Your Homelab!&amp;rdquo;&amp;quot; focus on Traefik reverse proxy server. Although this guide focuses on DuckDNS, a similar configuration can apply to any DNS provider.
The trick is by setting private IP for the domain name you own, in my case DuckDNS.
Get DuckDNS Sub-Domain Sign-up an account in duckdns.org, choose a sub-domain(As I choose a dummy sub-domain lser.duckdns.org) and add your home server IP address(In my case 192.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of the services I always wanted to have on my raspberry pi home server is VPN and BitTorrent, which basically, route all BitTorrent traffic through a VPN container. Then I saw Wolfgang&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Set Up Your Own Wireguard VPN Server with 2FA in 5 Minutes!&amp;rdquo; on Youtube, which inspired me to set up my own VPN server. I quickly created an instance on Oracle Cloud and ran the ansible playbook to deploy the wireguard VPN.</description>

      <description>Previously in part 1, we have deployed the qBittorrent with Wireguard VPN on docker swarm. In this part, we will test the deployment, configure qBittorrent and finish the blog with the kill switch configuration
Testing Below are the tests to make sure qBittorrent has access to the Internet through Wireguard VPN
➡️Make sure Wireguard and qBittorrent containers are up and running.
➡️Check you are able to ping Wireguard container from qBittorrent</description>

      <description>Introduction I have been working on my home server setup on Raspberry Pi 4. I&amp;rsquo;d like to deploy all of my services/tools in docker containers, and for that, I need a nice and fancy container management tool I want to have on my home server.
I had checked multiple sources, and finally picked two; they are Portainer and Yacht. Portainer is a well-known container management tool and Yacht is fairly new.</description>

      <title>Pi-hole with DHCP Relay in Docker</title>

      <description>Introduction I have been working on a RaspberryPi home server project for quite some time. The project is a collection of applications to run on RaspberryPi and all applications are deployable with docker-compose files and ansible automation. One of the applications I was configuring is Pi-hole, a network-wide ad-blocker.
I decided to use Pi-hole as also DHCP server for my LAN. When I look into docs, it says it has to be run as network_mode: host, because it allows Pi-hole to listen to DHCP broadcast packets.</description>
